    /*  Separation of Concerns is the principle of separating the different concerns of a software system
        into distinct modules. This principle ensures that each module has a well-defined responsibility
        and can be easily maintained.

              Also, Separation of Concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections,
         that each section addresses a separate concern. For example the business logic of the application is a
         concern and the user interface is another concern. Changing the user interface should not require changes
         to business logic and vice versa.

                                    // Why Separation Of Concern is needed
          * To simplify the development and maintenance of Software applications
          * When concerns are - well separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated
             independently.
                                    // How Separation Of Concern is implemented
          * Break program functionality into separate modules that overlap as little as possible.
